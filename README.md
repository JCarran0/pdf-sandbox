#About
A simple sandbox for playing around with generating PDFs from templated HTML.
The need is to allow schools to easily generate student progress reports for each student.

This project uses [Dust.js](http://www.dustjs.com/) for server-side HTML templating and [html-pdf](https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-pdf) for converting the templates to PDF.
